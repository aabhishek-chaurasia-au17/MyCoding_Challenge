"""
Q - 1 ) Write a program to find the upper bound (first occurrenceâ€™s index) of
a target given by the user, that should be present in the list. Using linear
search.
eg:
A= [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4]
lower bound of 2 = 3
upper bound of 2 = 5
Your code should return 5.
Write time and space complexity of your code.
