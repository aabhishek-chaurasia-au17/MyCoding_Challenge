Question 5 :
----------------
Given an array arr[], find the maximum j â€“ i such that arr[j] > arr[i] .
Input :- arr = [ 34, 8, 10, 3, 2, 80, 30, 33, 1]
Output : - 6 (j = 7, i = 1)
Explanation : -
Since at index ( j = 6 and i = 1 ) , we get maximum ( j - i ) where arr[j] > arr[i]
Sample :
Def find_max ( arr ):
Note : -
